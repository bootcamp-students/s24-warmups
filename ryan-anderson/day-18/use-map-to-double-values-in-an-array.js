function double(array) {

  function times2(x) {
    return x * 2;
  }

  return array.map(times2)
}

//use map to run array through a function that multiplies each item by 2
/*
  Ember's Feedback:
  - Good job! You realized that you can give map a function definition, whether it is in line or in a variable.
*/
// Alternative Solution
function double(array) {

  // This is what .map is. It is a function that exist on all instances of arrays because of prototype inheritance
  Array.prototype.customMap = function cutomMap(userFunction) {

    if (typeof userFunction !== 'function') throw `${typeof userFunction} is not a function`

    let returnArray = [];

    // "this" here is a way you can get the value of the thing that the function was called on.
    // so here, "this" is an array and specifically it is whatever is stored in the array variable we call .customMap on
    for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
      returnArray.push(userFunction(this[i], i, this))
    }

    return returnArray
  }

  // customMap works because we added it to the Array prototype above.
  // When we call customMap we give it a function to run on every element. (element => element * 2)
  return array.customMap(element => element * 2)
}
