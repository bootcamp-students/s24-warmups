function noSpace(x){
  return x.replaceAll(" ","")
}

/*

p: i have x which will give me a string. I will have characters
and spaces in that string. i need to manipulate it to remove the blanks.

R: should return a string with no spaces

E: "8 J B" --> "8JB"

C: im concerned that i dont know what will delete a space.
it should be a simple thing. read the string, return it differently.

p: all i have to do is learn, take it step by step, i am capable.

t: i discovered .replaceAll, learned that i can substitute " " (a space) with "" (no character)
