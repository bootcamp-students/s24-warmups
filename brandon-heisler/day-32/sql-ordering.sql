SELECT *
FROM companies
ORDER BY employees DESC;
/*
 I need to sort information in a table called companies by
 number of employees, high to low
 table schema should be:
 id
 ceo
 motto
 employees

 im not super sure where to start. maybe with seeing what i have access to.
 I queried the table i have to see what im working with,
 i need to just order by one column and by highest to lowest.
 i used order by and found DESC to change the direction of the sort

 /*
  Ember's Feedback:
  - Great job!
  - ORDER BY is very common and useful.
