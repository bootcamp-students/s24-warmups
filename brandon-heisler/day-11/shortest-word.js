using forEach, i want to compare a large number to each word length to
find the smallest. id the starting number is greater than the word length
then adopt the word length as the new answer.

  Ember's Feedback:
  - Good job!
  - 100 is probably rather arbitrary, but in the future if you need an arbitrary large number you can use Infinity
  - for this problem, you could also just use the length of the first word instead of 100.
*/
// Alternative Solution
function findShort(s) {
  return Math.min(...s.split(" ").map(word => word.length));
}

  The above can be a little confusing because of the order in which the expressions are resolved.
  1) calling Math.min, but we need to pass it a value or values as arguments
  2) spread operator (...), we are going to give many values as arguments and will get them by unpacking
    something. In this instance we will eventually unpack the elements from an array.
  3) s - the parameter variable that stores the argument value when the function is called
  4) .split - exists if the value in s is of datatype string. Returns an array of string elements
  5) .map - we immediately call the map array method on the array returned from .split. We give
    map a function we defined. This function will be called on every element in the array returned
    from .split. That array contains strings and those strings should be the words from the starting
    sentence "s" because words are separated by spaces in English. Strings have a length property so
    this map will return an array where every element from the starting array is now instead a number value
    which corresponds to its length. ['hi', 'Bob'] -> [2, 3]
  If you look back at 2, we take the array returned from 5 and unpack it. So we end up giving Math.min a
  bunch of number values. It will return to us the lowest number value from those arguments.
  6) We return from our function the value given to us from the Math.min function call.
