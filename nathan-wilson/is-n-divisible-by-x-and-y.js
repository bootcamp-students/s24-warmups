function isDivisible(n, x, y) {
  return n % x === 0 && n % y === 0;
}

// n is the number to test to see if it is divisible by x and y. All are integers
// reuturn value is a boolean
// n3 x3 y4 is false bevause 3 is not divisible by 4
// I may return the wrong value. I may have a logic issue.
// Take 9 and test if it divided by x oe y has a remainder. If it does return false. If not return true.
// I can do this! Its okay if i dont get it first try
