function century(year) {
  return Math.ceil(year / 100);
}

// the year which is an integer
// need to return an integer
// century(1705), 18
// I could forget to start at the century + 1 or i could do the math incorrectly
// Take the year devide it by 100 rouond it up and subtract 1 then return that value
// I can do this, if I mess up its not too complicated to fix
