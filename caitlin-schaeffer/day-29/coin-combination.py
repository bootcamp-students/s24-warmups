# Instructions: The function takes cents value (int) and needs to return the minimum number of coins combination of the same value.
# The function should return an array where
# coins[0] = pennies ==> $00.01
# coins[1] = nickels ==> $00.05
# coins[2] = dimes ==> $00.10
# coins[3] = quarters ==> $00.25
# Examples: coinCombo(6) --> [1, 1, 0, 0]
# Params: given an integer 
# Return: returns an array
# Concerns: naming all of the coins or just using the values in the function
# Solution: 

# Given Code: 
# def coin_combo(cents):
#     return

def coin_combo(cents):
    return
