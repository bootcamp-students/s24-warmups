/*
Instructions: You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. 
People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed 
next to such an item. Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like 
an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples: 
[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
Params: Gives us an array called 'names'
Return: a string
Solution: 

Given Code:
function likes(names) {
  // TODO
}
*/

/* First thought:
A function that returns the string value of the array 'names' and then concates it to
the phrase 'likes this' (with a few variables)
If the function is empty it needs to return ('no one likes this')
If the function returns more than three name it needs to list the first to name and 
then count all of the other names to return ('name, name, name and 2 others like this')
*/

function likes(names) {
    let names = ['']
    

  }
