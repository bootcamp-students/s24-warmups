/*
Params: You probably know the "like" system from Facebook and other pages. 
People can "like" blog posts, pictures or other items. We want to create the text that should be displayed 
next to such an item. Implement the function which takes an array containing the names of people that like 
an item. It must return the display text as shown in the examples: 
[]                                -->  "no one likes this"
["Peter"]                         -->  "Peter likes this"
Return: a string
Solution: 

Given Code:
function likes(names) {
  // TODO
}
*/

/* First thought:
A function that adds an array to the string 'likes this' but must include some parameter that only lets it
display two names and then displays an additional number of people ' and others like this'
*/

function likes(names) {
    // TODO
  }
