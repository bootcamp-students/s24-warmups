/*
Params: Create a function that checks if a number n is divisible by two numbers x AND y. 
All inputs are positive, non-zero numbers.
Return value: should return true or false
Exmaple: n = 10; x = 5; y = 2; true (10 is divisible by both x and y)
Ideas: I think a good code could be something that checks if the product 
of n/x and n/y is a decimal. If it's a decimal return false, if it isn't it's true
*/

function isDivisible(n, x, y) {
    if (true) {(n/x), (n/y) = whole number;}
    
    else (false) {(n/x) = decimal; (n/y) = decimal;}
  }
