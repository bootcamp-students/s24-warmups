def create_phone_number(n):
    return "({}{}{}) {}{}{}-{}{}{}{}".format(*n)

# Parameters- n, a phone number
#Return my function should return a phone number for the given output
#Example 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]), "(123) 456-7890";
#concerns I don't know how to look up methods or i use the wrong method or the wrong syntax
#Explain- I will use the format method of the numbers.which will make the numbers into a string
# i can use brackets so that each number can pass as its own arguement. I hope i said that right, 
#the (*) allows for python to read that there will be a tuple in the return so that it will format the numbers in n into a phone number along with the brackets 
# Positive Talk, we have done this before, and Python is much easier. Just need to learn how to search what I need.
