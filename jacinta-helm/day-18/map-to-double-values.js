function double(array) {
    // Use array.map() to return a new array with each value twice
    // as large as the corresponding value in the passed in array.
  console.log('array', array);
//   let numbers = []
//   let numbers = doubledNumbers.map(doubledNumber => number * 2)
  return array.map(element => element * 2)
  
}

//P create a function that doubles the numbers in the array
// R my function should return the numbers in the array doubled in the answer. 
//Example [1,2,3,4,5] is = [2,4,6,8,10]);
// C concern would be syntax or not remebering how to get the answer.
//Explain, use the map over function to make the math and multiply the element by 2.
