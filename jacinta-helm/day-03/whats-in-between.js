// P create a function that has a range
// create an array
// have the index starting at the first/ lowest number (a)
// have index increase by one to create the rangeâ‰¥

/* Ember's Feedback:
  Great job!
  This is implementing what you will see is a "range" once we get to Python,
  like you mentioned in your pseudocode
